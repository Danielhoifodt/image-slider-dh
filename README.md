# image-slider-dh
This is a image slider made in javascript. See readme for instructions.

Insert images into the img folder and then edit the images.js file... put each source of image one after another... the order you want. See the demo files provided in this repo.

In the config/settings.js file you can manipulate the values of the object to your likings. Like duration of slides, fade in time, width and hight of images.

One tip is to find good images and replace with the ones in this repo.

Code is in master branch.

Good luck, and hope it has a function in your website.
